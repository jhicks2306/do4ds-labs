This is a Quarto website created as part of the exercises from [DevOps for Data Science](https://do4ds.com/). It contains:

- Basic [EDA](eda.qmd) for the Palmer Penguins data set.
- Sample code training a simple machine-learning [model](model.qmd)

The website has not been refined. It was constructed simply to practice the process of deployment using Quarto and GitHub actions.
